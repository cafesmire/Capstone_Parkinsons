# Capstone_Parkinsons
This capstone project leverages data from the Center for the Study of Movement, Cognition, and Mobility Neurological Institute and Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center to predict gait freezing episodes in Parkinson's Disease patients using various deep learning models. The project evaluates the efficacy of different architectures, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), and Gated Recurrent Unit Networks (GRUs).

* Data Source: 3d biometric accelerometer data from Parkinson's patients
* Objective: Predict gait freezing episodes with high accuracy
* Models used:
    * Artificial Neural Networks
    * Recurrent Neural Networks
    * Long Short-Term Memory Networks
    * Gated Recurrent Unit Networks
 
* Data Processing: Raw data -> Cleaned & transformed -> Model input data
* Model Training and Tuning: Train and tune several model architectures within each deep learning model until the best hyperparameters for each model are selected.
* Model Evaluation: Submissions are evaluated using Mean Average Precision and utilize Tensorboard to visually demonstrate the performance of each model during training and validation.
