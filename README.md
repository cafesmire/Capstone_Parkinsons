# Capstone_Parkinsons
Capstone project using data from the Center for the Study of Movement, Cognition, and Mobility Neurological Institute and Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center that demonstrates the efficacy of various model architectures in predicting gait freezing episodes based on values obtained from three-dimensional biometric accelerometers. This project tests the capabilities of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), and Gated Recurrent Unit Networks (GRUs) taking processed data inputs and generating accurate predictions of when these gait-freezing episodes were transpiring.
